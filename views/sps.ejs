      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">IEEE Signal Processing Society</h1>
      <p>The IEEE's first society, the Signal Processing Society is the world’s premier professional society for signal processing scientists and professionals since 1948.
        Signal processing is the enabling technology for the generation, transformation, and interpretation of information. SPS serves its members through high quality publications, conferences, technical and educational activities, and leadership opportunities. 
        Its goal is to keep members abreast of the latest information and to serve the public at large.</p>
        <n><p> the Signal Processing Society is the world’s premier association for signal processing engineers and industry professionals. Engineers around the world look to the Society for information on the latest developments in the signal processing field. Its deeply rooted history spans almost 70 years, featuring a membership base of more than 19,000 deeply interested and involved signal processing engineers, academics, industry professionals and students who are all part of a dynamic global community – spanning 100 countries worldwide.

          The Society organizes numerous conferences around the world every year, focusing on the innovations shaping the future of signal processing and the future of our world.

          Members have opportunities to be involved in boards and committees, and at the local 
          level members are actively immersed in regional chapters, working on issues and projects that shape what’s next in signal processing.</p></n>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What is Signal Processing?</h1>
      <p>The technology we use, and rely on, in our everyday lives–including computers, radios, video devices, cell phones, smart connected devices and more–is enabled by signal processing, a branch of electrical engineering that models and analyzes
         data representations of physical events as well as data generated across multiple disciplines. Hence, signal processing is at the heart of our modern world. It’s at the intersection of biotechnology, entertainment, and social interactions. It enhances our ability to communicate and share information. Signal processing is the
          science behind our digital lives.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Signal Processing Society Mission, Vision & Diversity </h1>
      <p>Signal processing is the enabling technology for the generation, transformation, extraction, and interpretation of information. It comprises the theory, algorithms with associated architectures and implementations,
        and applications related to processing information contained in many different formats
         broadly designated as signals. Signal processing uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and/or linguistic representations, formalisms, modeling techniques and algorithms for generating, transforming, transmitting, and learning from signals.
        </p><n><p>
          The Signal Processing Society is an international organization whose purpose is to: advance and disseminate state-of-the-art scientific information and resources; educate the signal processing community; and provide a venue for people to interact and exchange ideas.
        </p><n>
          <p>
            The Signal Processing Society is a dynamic organization that is the preeminent source of signal processing information and resources to a global community. We do this by: being a one-stop source of signal processing resources; providing a variety of high quality resources to a variety of users in formats customized to their interests; adapting to a rapidly changing technical community;
             and being intimately involved in the education of signal processing professionals at all levels.
          </p>
        </n>
        
        <n>
          <p>
            The IEEE Signal Processing Society adheres to the IEEE Code of Conduct and is committed to providing equal opportunity to its members, regardless of ethnicity, race, nationality, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, religion, gender, age, and/or personal identity. The Society is committed
             to a welcoming and inclusive environment that promotes diversity in the signal processing community.
